Will transfer your listed Rivens from Warframe.Market to Riven.Market.


needs to install selenium before starting:
pip install selenium


1. Run start.py (or do it via the Start.bat)
2. Provide your Riven.market login Detail (will crash if not correct password)
	- All Information is kept on your device and cannot be accessed by me in any form.
3. Provide your Warframe.market Username (Case sensitive)
4. Select if you want to delete your old Riven.market listings. This may take a while but is recommended in order to avoid duplicates.
5. ???
6. Profit

Notes:
- Use at your own risk and do not overdo it. You will land on peoples blocklists if you relist too often. Also I do not know how happy riven.market Mods are if you relist every 10min.
- Currently takes the starting price of auctions. Might add a feature to enable currently highest bid and/or starting price + x later.
- Riven.Market has no API. WHY?!?
